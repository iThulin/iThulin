Hi, I'm iTHulin or Ian. I'm a new developer and am interested in web and software develpoment. Currently I work mostly in python/django but am learning javascript and node.js. I have a healthy obsession with Warhammer Age of Sigmar and love painting new models for my army and dnd monster collection.
